        Hi, my name is Seog-Jun Hong, and I am currently studiyng Computer
        Programming & Analysis at Seneca College. I love programming and making
        something new and cool! Specifically, I'm quite interested in developing
        web app by React. Programming always makes me feel a sense of
        accomplishment and get motivated by learning new stuff.
